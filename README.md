Abstract:
Over the last years, a variety of automated machine learning frameworks have become popular. They have achieved state of the art results, as well as lowered the barrier of entry for non experts. However most of these frameworks only focus on singular performance metrics and are not able to take multiple performance metrics into account. Often, real world applications are interested in multiple metrics besides raw performance like fairness, robustness and compute time.

In this paper we evaluate different ways to combine and regularize multiple different metrics during AutoML as well as show a novel highly interpretable way to obtain desired minimum performance values and guide the AutoML search without any hyperparameter fine tuning towards sensible exploration.
