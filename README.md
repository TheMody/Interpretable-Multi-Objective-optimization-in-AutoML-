Abstract:
Over the last years, a variety of different Natural language Processing approaches have been explored. Mostly based upon the transformer architecture, these approaches are evaluated on a variety of different NLP tasks. In the search for better performance on these task other metrics to evaluate these approaches are often overlooked. 

In this paper we will look at a variety of combinations of different transformer architectures and subsequent classification algorithms not just in terms of raw performance on the dataset, but also in terms of computational requirements and robustness.

We evaluate different ways to combine these metrics during AutoML and show a novel highly interpretable way to obtain desired minimum performance values.
